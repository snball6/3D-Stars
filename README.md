# 3D-Stars
3D star built from polygonal mesh with Java OpenGL (JOGL)

For my Computer Graphics course, several of the assignments involved creating unique 3D scenes using Java OpenGL (JOGL). Inspired by the origami paper stars I like to make, I created a 3D polygonal mesh to mimic the shape. I then adapted code from our textbook's examples to place my stars in a scene with lighting and a viewing perspectives that can be manipulated by the viewer.
